# BRAIN WAVE

The project was to build a responsive and interactive webb game that acts the same on all devices.
The UI/UX needed to be easy to oprate and interactive to the user for the webb game to be fun for all age ranges.
 
## UI/UX
 
### User Stories

The project was started by looking at the needs and requirements, for the owner and external users.
Once this had been done the user stories were added to a project board.[user stories](https://github.com/matt-pearson29/brain-wave/blob/master/mockups/Brain%20Wave%20_%20Trello.pdf

### Wire Frame Mock ups

After the user stories had been completed, Wire frame mock ups were designed for the webb game and agreed with the owner, as well as with a selction of external users.
